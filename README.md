# About

The points of interest viewer is an interactive web application that incorporates both the PapaParse and Tabulator JavaScript libraries to parse CSV data and convert it into usable JSON data. This is then fed into both Pano2VR and/or Potree's APIs in any web application that supports one or both if these tools. The result is a spreadsheet wherein selecting a row of location data will teleport the user immediately to the nearest capture point in a geographical survey and orient the camera to face the point of interest, which can be then be viewed in either Pano2VR or Potree's respective viewers. When used in Conjunction with my customized version of Potree, it is a powerful tool for rapid analysis of precise survey data for use in everyday engineering workflows.

The feature set can be seen in this video (https://youtu.be/J4_WQ6OsuOc) from 2:05 to 10:00.
